# EaseEd

## About The Project
The idea of the project came up to remove the queue culture in schools. EaseEd provides a platform to compare the schools on the basis of ratings and apply to multiple private schools in a locality, using a single common application form to replace the queue culture for admission in hot Summer season. The application also aims to facilitate the delivery of books, uniforms and other requirements of the students. EaseEd plans to extend its capabilities to coaching systems, colleges and universities, in near future.
